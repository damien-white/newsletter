# Newsletter

## Description
__Newsletter__ is a simple email newsletter subscription service. It is primarily a backend service, however I will create a "mock" browser-based client to showcase how the service would be used in a realistic scenario.

### Purpose
This project serves as an integral part of my journey and quest to learn the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
